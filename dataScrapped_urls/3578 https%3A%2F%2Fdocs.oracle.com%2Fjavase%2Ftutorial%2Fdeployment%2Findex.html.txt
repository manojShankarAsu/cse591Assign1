Traditionally, applications construct their user interfaces, including the top-level Frame, in the main method. This programming style prevents easy re-deployment of the application in the browser, because it assumes that the application creates its own Frame. When running in the browser as an applet, the applet is the top level container that should hold the user interface for the application. A top-level Frame is not needed.
