I agree with what you have said regarding the aim of the book not being clearly defined and structured. What I feel lacking in this book is, in actuality, the decent progression from beginner level topics to advanced. This book clearly needs to adopt a difficulty progression. I believe we should start discussing about the organisation of the book as soon as is possible and begin implementing it simultaneously. I also would strongly like to get rid of all the templates (e.g., content templates, content sub-categories templates, template for keywords within code snippets, etcetera) being used by this book.
