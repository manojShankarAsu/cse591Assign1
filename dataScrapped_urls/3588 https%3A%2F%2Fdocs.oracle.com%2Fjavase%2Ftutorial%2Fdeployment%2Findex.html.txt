Use component-based architecture when designing your Java rich internet application. Try to organize its functionality into one or more components that can be composed together. In this context, the term "component" refers to a GUI element that is a subclass of the AWT Component class, the Swing JComponent class, or another subclass. For example, you could have a top level JPanel which contains other UI components in it (like a combination of more nested JPanels and text fields, combo boxes etc.). With such a design, it becomes relatively easy to deploy the core functionality as an applet or a Java Web Start application.
