I've made a new page Java_Programming/Beginning_Java, I think it's a good idea to start moving/modifying/adding pages to it, so that the links appear as Java_Programming/Beginning_Java/Pages_Go_Here, but I don't know if this is the best option so waiting for the green light from major authors before I start work on it. --Mattylaws (talk) 13:16, 10 March 2010 (UTC)
