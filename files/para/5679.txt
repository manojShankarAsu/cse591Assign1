Extensions are groups of packages and classes that augment the Java platform through the extension mechanism. The extension mechanism enables the runtime environment to find and load extension classes without the extension classes having to be named on the class path. In that respect, extension classes are similar to the Java platform's core classes. That's also where extensions get their name -- they, in effect, extend the platform's core API.
