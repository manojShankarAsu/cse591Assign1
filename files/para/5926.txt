As you are typing in the IDE, a code completion box might periodically appear. You can either ignore the code completion box and keep typing, or you can select one of the suggested expressions. If you would prefer not to have the code completion box automatically appear, you can turn off the feature. Choose Tools | Options | Editor, click the Code Completion tab and clear the Auto Popup Completion Window checkbox.
