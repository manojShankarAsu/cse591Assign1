Another suggestion that I would like to make here is the inclusion of short tutorial-like progressive build-ups of code snippets for every topic being discussed. This would ensure that the reading comes natural and easy to the reader. Plus, I find definitions of keywords and techniques in separate paragraphs or notes, rather than flowing within text, very misleading for the beginners. We can work on a separate glossary for every thing at the end of the book for quick references.
