Regular Expressions are a way to describe a set of strings based on common characteristics shared by each string in the set. They can be used to search, edit, or manipulate text and data. Regular expressions vary in complexity, but once you understand the basics of how they're constructed, you'll be able to decipher (or create) any regular expression. This lesson teaches the regular expression syntax supported by the java.util.regex API, and presents several working examples to illustrate how the various objects interact.
