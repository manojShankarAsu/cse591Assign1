Save the code in a file with the name HelloWorldApp.java. In the Pico editor, you do this by typing Ctrl-O and then, at the bottom where you see the prompt File Name to write:, entering the directory in which you wish to create the file, followed by HelloWorldApp.java. For example, if you wish to save HelloWorldApp.java in the directory /tmp/examples/java, then you type /tmp/examples/java/HelloWorldApp.java and press Return.
