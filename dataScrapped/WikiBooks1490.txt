Hi there, thanks for your reply, sorry I have been away from wikibooks for a while due to life commitments. I agree with your statements concerning a progression through topics, from beginner through to advance. I think a major mistake that can be made is constructing a book while trying to cater all audiences at once, while constructing a tutorial, it's very easy to include everything on that topic rather than just the bare details a person of a certain expertise needs to know at that point in their progression. So major consideration is needed to what is included in a topic and what is left to be mentioned at a higher level, allowing more focus on teaching those at that level.
