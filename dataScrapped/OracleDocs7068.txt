Something I see as one of the most important issues: I'm not sure there are any clear aims in this book, I think that the general idea is to design the book as a reference and a book for new comers in Java and programming, but I don't think this really shows, at the moment its a mass of jumbled writings to do with Java, but this is a start, all we need to do now is define a solid book purpose or aim and then we can start really tackling the layout and writing style.
