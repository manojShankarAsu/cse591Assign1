You can compile and run an individual file (as opposed to a whole project) using the IDE's Compile File (F9) and Run File (Shift-F6) commands. If you use the Run Main Project command, the IDE will run the file that the IDE associates as the main class of the main project. Therefore, if you create an additional class in your HelloWorldApp project and then try to run that file with the Run Main Project command, the IDE will run the HelloWorldApp file instead.
