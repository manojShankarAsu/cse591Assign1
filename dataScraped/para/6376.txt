"Hello World!" for the NetBeans IDE These instructions are for users of the NetBeans IDE. The NetBeans IDE runs on the Java platform, which means that you can use it with any operating system for which there is a JDK 7 available. These operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Solaris OS, Linux, and Mac OS X. We recommend using the NetBeans IDE instead of the command line whenever possible.
