These sort of ideas do in fact need a major overhaul of the book structure and layout. I found it quite confusing trying to navigate around, so I agree with the deletion of all the templates, I don't know if there is an easier method of maintaining the structure of a book without turning it into a completely flat hierarchy (or should we turn it into a flat hierarchy?). I hope there is some sort of framework for the ordering of pages, chapters, sections etc, where just changing one item would reorder them (keeping the ordering to just one area), being a programmer I always see code maintainability of utmost importance.
