The full program and file example should definitely be held within a box, with the file name at the top, line numbers down the left hand side, and alternating striped colours for the lines, take a look at pastebin and some of their codes. This would need an external stylesheet. Ok after a little looking around I figured out what templates are and how to use them, and found Template:Code, nearly exactly what I needed, so I modified it and made a new Template:Java_Code_File, ready to be used.
