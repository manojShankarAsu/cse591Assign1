Dear All, I would like to express my interest to contribute in the content of the wiki/Java_Programming WikiBooks. I personally feel that this book will be a very useful introductory to Java programming for beginners. I would like to propose the following two sub topics for inclusion in the book: Java_Programming/Algorithms and Java_Programming/Flow_Chart. Let me know your view! Thanks!
