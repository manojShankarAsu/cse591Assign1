If you want to rename the node for a source file in the Projects window, choose Refactor from IDE's main menu. The IDE prompts you with the Rename dialog box to lead you through the options of renaming the class and the updating of code that refers to that class. Make the changes and click Refactor to apply the changes. This sequence of clicks might seem unnecessary if you have just a single class in your project, but it is very useful when your changes affect other parts of your code in larger projects.
